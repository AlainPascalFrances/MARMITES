# MARMITES
MM-MF model output is a daily spatial water balance of the catchment that quantifies the partitioning of: (i) subsurface fluxes into unsaturated and saturated zone components; (ii) saturated zone fluxes into groundwater recharge, groundwater uptake by plants, direct evaporation from water table and groundwater runoff. Output are kept in HDF5 files (see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) and they are automatically exported at user-defined observations points in ASCII files to allow their importing in other software such as Microsoft Excel. MM also produces images and plots to visualize spatial data and time series data.

Operationally, MM is programmed in Python and requires 3 types of ASCII files to run. The 1st type correspond to INI files that are required to initialize the 3 MM-MF components (MMsurf, MMsoil and MF). The 2nd ASCII file type is ESRI ASCII GRID, required to provide spatial parameters and variables to the MM-MF model. The 3rd type provides the times series of meteorological data, observations and other. To interact with MF, we use a Python pre and post-processor called FloPy (see https://modflowpy.github.io/flopydoc/index.html).
