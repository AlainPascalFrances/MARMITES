Start with start_pyEARTH1D.py


The original EARTH model is not open source, here it is a exe file that works under DOS: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zqtmtaaijohnfik/XMnTAygmF_.During MSc, I reprogrammed it in Python using the info of the manual, I called it pyEARTH and this one is open source! However no exe file available, one needs to install Python 3.* and some packages.
Here it goes specific instructions:
1 - Install python 3.*, numpy, scipy, win32 and wxpython packages.
2 - Download the following files:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2eu20t8gnosn7ys/AAB0tcOTQg1hm_FX8OvMWjeGa?dl=0
3 - Double click on start_pyEARTH1D.py
4 - if it works, continue next step otherwise send me the error message (if you don't see the error message, start pyEARTH1D in a DOS windows)
5 - unzip the folder attached to this email, it contains the input data
6 - in pyEART1D, go to File, load All (Folder) and select the unzipped folder
7 - now you can run the main algorithm by pressing the blue buttons buttons below the parameters boxes (the difference between them is in the plots that are shown).
8 - optionally, you can export the output in Ascii format to be processed in XLS or other any program

About the equations and theory, please report to my MSc thesis here:http://www.lneg.pt/CienciaParaTodos/edicoes_online/teses/alain_frances
or to the original EARTH manual.
